## Welcome to 2048 Bright

2048 Bright is a game build by Chris Mosey and Topher Rouleau for the Spectrum at [THEMUSEUM](https://themuseum.ca/) Downtown Kitchener.

## The Hardware

The Hardware we used consisted of the following:

+ some chinese arduino
+ 4 LED light strips consisting of 16 lights per strip
+ 4 arcade buttons
+ 3d printed something or other
+ wood that was cut using a laser
+ many many wires

some blurb about the assembly

## The Software

The code for the game was originally taken from [2048.c](https://github.com/mevdschee/2048.c) and modified to run on an arduino. In the end, the code needed heavy modifications to run on the arduino. The biggest issue we ran into was connecting to the LED light strips using the Adafruit_NeoPixel library. The Arduino turns on 4 LEDs to represent 1 block on the system.
